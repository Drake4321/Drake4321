- 👋 Hi, I’m @Drake4321
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to code, and protect myself from a very good coder who continue to get all my information.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all I can with the detection of how  I'm continually being a victim of hackers.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on help on how to recognize what to look for.
- 📫 How to reach me ...here
